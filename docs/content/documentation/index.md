# Documentation

Stone is simple framework agnostic , theme based **css-in-js** library. Due to the nature of the library the documentation is a bit dense, do go through the implementations as much as you can or head to the issues to report things that you think needs fixing.

**NOTE**: This documentation is for versions **v1.0.0** and above
